# Grading System 
- This grading system works hand-in-hand with my [course policies](http://drewloewe.net/policies/).
- **NB**: These terms are subject to adjustments based on a) an official "504 letter" re: reasonable accommodation of a learning challenge or b) other reasonable actions on a case-by-case basis (please discuss those with me; don't assume anything).
## I. How I Evaluate Your Work
-  For major projects, I will use a points-based scale and rubric (as well as comments and feedback). 
- Some work is not revisable (e.g., quizzes, peer review, discussion posts, weekly activities, synthesis charts, etc.), but all major writing projects are revisable. Please read [my revision policies](http://drewloewe.net/policies/). If you revise a major project effectively and follow the policies so I can evaluate it in context, I will simply change the original grade (I don't weight or average them; revisions are "do-overs"). The grade is not guaranteed to increase, but it will certainly NOT decrease. Depending on whether your class is part of the Rumi pilot, I might have two submissions with the lower one dropped or simply have you submit a revision in the same place where you submitted the original. **Please make sure that you know when, where, and how to turn in a revision.**
- Submitted work will be evaluated using a simple point scale and a specific rubric. The point scale is keyed to four basic descriptors:
  - **100%--Excellent**--follows all directions; meets all expectations for what the assignment asks you to develop; overall, notably substantive and polished 
  - **85%--Strong**--follows all directions; meets most expectations for what the assignment asks you to develop; overall, solid with a few areas to improve
  - **70%-Passing**--may or may not follow all directions; overall does not yet meet most expectations for what the assignment asks you to develop; significant areas to improve
  - **0%--Not Passing**--*even if submitted:* may or may not follow all directions; overall, meets few or no expectations for what the assignment asks you to develop (major development, refocusing, or reworking needed); *if not submitted*: unreadable file, non-working link, or not submitted at all
- The first thing I look for in any submission in any class is: *does this do all of what is expected in the writing situation?* If it does one thing, kinda-sorta does some other things, and simply does not do other things at all, there is a problem that revision can address, but that keeps the initial submission from passing. **You must submit all of what an assignment asks for, or it cannot pass. I don't do, say, 50% partial credit for "just turning something in" on major submissions. The available grades are 0%, 70%, 85%, and 100%.**
-  When I get a “kinda-sorta + omissions” submission, I feel like a diner who is served half a hamburger on a whole-wheat bun, sweet potato fries, and pickled okra when I ordered a whole burger on brioche, waffle fries, and grilled vegetables. This “wait...what?” situation is why I don’t use partial credit schemes for non-passing submissions. I view such schemes as contrived, infantilizing, and debilitating for all concerned. I would not give the restaurant 50% of the cost of what I actually ordered if I was served something other than what I ordered. I give feedback and a “do-over” chance, which is what happens among adults all the time in all kinds of situations.

Here is another way of looking at the mentality behind the grading system that I use:

|                 | Followed all directions? | Developed everything asked for? | Performance on what was developed:                 |
|-----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Excellent (100%)       | Yes                      | Yes                             | Notably well-executed                              |
| Strong   (85%)       | Yes                      | Yes                             | Minor areas for improvement; eligible for do-over revision                       |
| Passing  (70%)       | Probably not                    | Probably not                               | Significant areas for improvement;  eligible for do-over revision           |
| Not Yet Passing (0%)| Most likely not          | Almost certainly not                        | Major development, refocusing, or reworking needed;  eligible for do-over revision |

---
- For major projects, 90% of the available points are for content and 10% are for form and mechanics.
-  Items graded all-or-nothing or Complete/Incomplete will have a simple descriptor of the specifications for a good-faith, useful, responsive submission that does what the item is supposed to do (typically, spark discussion, help you work out your ideas, or give me useful information about questions that students have). A good-faith, useful, responsive submission earns all the possible points.
## II. Final Course Grades
I opted out of the university's plus-minus grading system. I assign whole grades, e.g., A, B, etc. I grade on a slightly lowered percentage scale, so *de facto* "extra credit" or "wiggle room" is already built in to the course. Please don't ask for more.

| Your Final Grade         | Percentage of Available Points Earned |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| A                      |  88% or more of available points earned |
| B                      |  78% - 87% of available points earned |
| C                      |  68% - 77% of available points earned |
| D                      |  58% - 67% of available points earned |
| F                      |  57% or less of available points earned |

In WRIT 2302, I will assign a grade of NP instead of an earned D or F because WRIT 2302 requires a grade of C or better to pass.

Note: Regardless of other performance in any course, a student who commits a serious act of academic dishonesty as defined by the applicable Bulletin, Student Handbook, or other university policy might be assigned a final grade of F for that course.
