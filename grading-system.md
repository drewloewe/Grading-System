# Labor- and Performance-Based Grading System 
- This labor- and performance-based grading system works hand-in-hand with my [course policies](http://drewloewe.net/policies/).
- *NB: These terms are subject to adjustments based on a) an official "504 letter" re: reasonable accommodation of a learning challenge or b) other reasonable actions on a case-by-case basis (please discuss those with me).
## I. The Labor-Based Part
### Show Up/Engage Regularly and Punctually; Stay in Touch** 

**Traditional Classes**: Attend class regularly and on time; do not miss more than three class meetings total and do not miss any peer-review activities; log into Canvas regularly and make sure that you know what is going on, what you have to do, and when; stay in touch with professor and peers.

**Online classes** Same as above, but you won’t show up to a classroom. Your use of Canvas should be daily because that’s the only way that you will know what is going on.

### Meet Deadlines
- Meet deadlines for all work—items are due when the calendar specifies. **But**: During the regular semester (not finals week), you may turn in one major project assignment (including the self-assessments) up to 24 hours past its due date. Other assignments and activities **do not** come with this option—especially peer review drafts. In addition, the deadline for revisions to major projects due during finals week can't be extended because the university imposes a tight deadline on faculty to turn in final grades.

### Read Attentively and Actively
-	Buy, rent, or access any required textbook(s); download or access (and consider printing) all other required readings.
-	Read all assigned readings closely and annotate them thoughtfully *before* class meetings in F2F classes and before you need to use them in online classes. (All readings are fair game for quizzes and other activities).
-	Use active reading strategies, such as [Casey Boyle's six-step reading response](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z1t_ft-HqFO9pK-LQtaASnyqmfh9kbnc6Mp2LzYKjNE/edit?usp=sharing) and the [SQ3R method](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UQpnr27g58ABgOJXQzTny8AD4V2TZGYebM2tKUVjzaM/edit?usp=sharing). 
### Seek Guidance as a Adult Learner
-	Talk to me during in-class workshops, email me as needed, bring me drafts, come to student visiting hours in [my office], ask questions, and otherwise use me proactively as a resource. Use a Google Chat appointment if you can't come see me.
- **NB:** If I ask you to meet with me in person or virtually, you *must* do so. **If I ask to see you, it's not some kind of punishment; rather, it's one grownup asking another to come get expert help that can best be delivered in person.**
- Use [the Writing Center](https://www.stedwards.edu/writing-center), whether by in-person session, videoconference, or asynchronous session as needed and (especially) as suggested.
### Protect your Work
- Save your work in ways that do not make you depend 100% on the health of a particular hard drive or flash drive (e.g., use Google Drive).
### Avoid Distractions *
Don’t distract yourself during work time with smartphones, tablets, or computers used for non-work tasks. Ordinarily, there is no reason to text during class, though you (and I) may need to from time to time for various reasons. 

This admonition is even more important in online courses—you must exercise more discipline in online courses to avoid distractions. 

### Dig Into the Work

-	**It all counts--there is no busy work.** Don't just show up/log in/keep from being a distraction. In a college course, you need to offer insights, ask questions, answer questions, bring necessary materials, dig into quizzes, class discussions, and activities, confer during workshops, participate in discussion boards on Canvas, and do assigned homework and in-process activities. 
-	If you are asked to do team activities or projects, make yourself available to your teammate, figure out and negotiate how to share the work, and give helpful, honest, detailed responses to any prompt asking you to evaluate your teammate's performance. I generally will use [this rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aTyt2w4UrBqES1jrlHlnNmxtjDqTShSJMAqli1H6sps/edit?usp=sharing) for such a prompt. That is also how you will be evaluated by your teammate. Blowing off a teammate's input, ghosting, or expecting them to do more than their fair share of work are all breaches of the grading contract. I reserve the right to break up teams and assign different grades, if warranted. 
-	Bring (or submit) ["good faith full drafts" (your best effort-in-progress attempting the whole project) for peer review sessions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q_s-kbesVB7n7kQKZA2jJ2Vt9V-jv7abUDPOIWP5RSk/edit?usp=sharing). 
-	Give thoughtful, useful, honest peer feedback. If we do hard-copy peer review in F2F classes, keep track of peer review evidence so your partner can get credit.
-	Submit what each assignment or activity asks for, e.g., if an assignment asks for four sections with specific headings or three peer-reviewed scholarly sources, your submission can't ignore such requirements. Don't blast off from the assignment and turn in some other kind of work. This is not to say that you can't be creative, but you need to do what the assignment asks, not just *some of it* or *something sort of like it*.
-	Submit all required self-assessments, completed thoroughly and specifically. 

## II. The Performance-Based Part
### Complete/Incomplete-Graded Activities and Assignments
- For some activities and assignments, I will use a simple binary scale: 
	- **&#10004;** Complete, meaning you turned it in and it meets its particular specifications
	- **&#10008;** Incomplete, meaning that you did not turn it in, or it does not meet its particular specifications
- [Canvas's grade book](https://media.giphy.com/media/26FPy3QZQqGtDcrja/giphy.gif) does not handle some features of grading well, but we're stuck with it. For purposes of the grade book, each graded event has certain levels of performance, even if the grade book in Canvas calls it "ungraded" or "does not count toward final grade" (those are workarounds necessitated by Canvas's irritating fixation on points and percentages). 
### Points-Graded Activities, Exams, Quizzes, and Assignments 
- For other activities and assignments, I will use a points-based scale and rubric for that assignment (as well as comments and feedback).  
- Not everything is revisable (e.g., quizzes, peer review, exams, etc.), but major writing projects are revisable. Please read [my revision policies](http://drewloewe.net/policies/). If you revise a major project effectively, I will simply change the grade (I don't weight or average them). The grade is not guaranteed to increase, but it will certainly NOT decrease.
- Typically, points-graded work will have a simple points scale keyed to the basic four descriptors of Meets All Expectations; Meets Most Expectations; Shows Effort, but Doesn’t Yet Meet Most Expectations; and Not Assessable.

## III. Final Course Grades

I opt out of the university's plus-minus grading system. I will assign whole grades, e.g., A, B, etc.

### A 
The student:
- _meets_ the requirements of the labor-based part of this system;
- _earns_ 90+% of the total available points once all points-graded activities, exams, quizzes, and assignments are complete
- _submits_ all complete/incomplete-graded activities and assignments and earn grade of “complete.”
###  B 
The student:
- _meets_ the requirements of the labor-based part of this system;
- _earns_ 80-89% of the total available points once all points-graded activities, exams, quizzes, and assignments are complete
- _submits_ all complete/incomplete-graded activities and assignments and earn grade of “complete.”
### C 
The student:
- _meets_ the requirements of the labor-based part of this system;
- _earns_ 70-79% of the total available points once all points-graded activities, exams, quizzes, and assignments are complete. 
- _submits_ all but a couple of the complete/incomplete-graded activities and assignments and earn grade of “complete.”
###  NP (in WRIT 1301 or 2302) or D (in other courses) 
The student:
- _meets_ most of the requirements of the labor-based part of this system;
- _earns_ 60-69% of the total available points once all points-graded activities, exams, quizzes, and assignments are complete (D- is not an available grade);
- _submits_ some of the complete/incomplete-graded activities and assignments and earn grade of “complete.”
### F
The student:
- _meets few of the requirements of the labor-based part of this system;
- _earns_ <60% of the total available points once all points-graded activities, exams, quizzes, and assignments are complete;
- _submits_ few of the complete/incomplete-graded activities and assignments and earn grade of “complete”;
- _commits_ a serious act of academic dishonesty (NB: dishonesty can by itself result in a final grade of F)
### You Get to Make an Argument
- In the final self-assessment, you should make a *reasonable, supported argument* to me about what overall course grade you believe is warranted. I do want to hear from you since I try to defer ultimate assigning of a course grade until I have all the evidence and your input as a grownup. 
- I am not bound by your arguments, but I will consider them if they are supported. Here, **argument = reasonable claim + sufficient evidence + warranted inferences**. Wishes, mere pleas, and schmoozing are not arguments. See the final self-assessment assignment. 
- This is your chance to show me the full picture beyond my own recollections, comments, and grade book.
