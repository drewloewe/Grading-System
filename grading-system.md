# Labor- and Performance-Based Grading System 
- This labor- and performance-based grading system works hand-in-hand with my [course policies](http://drewloewe.net/policies/).
- *NB: These terms are subject to adjustments based on a) an official "504 letter" re: reasonable accommodation of a learning challenge or b) other reasonable actions on a case-by-case basis (please discuss those with me).
## I. The Labor-Based Part
### Show Up/Engage Regularly and Punctually; Stay in Touch

**Traditional Classes**: Attend class regularly and on time; do not miss more than three class meetings total and do not miss any peer-review activities; log into Canvas regularly and make sure that you know what is going on, what you have to do, and when; stay in touch with professor and peers.

**Online classes** Same as above, but you won’t show up to a classroom. Your use of Canvas should be daily because that’s the only way that you will know what is going on. In synchronous classes, you need to log in to Zoom, sign in for attendance, and participate via voice, camera (if desired), chat, and other ways. No logging in, then bailing--you will be expected to participate by talking, responding to polls, working in groups, posting in chat, and other ways. You will also need to complete quizzes, discussions, and other activities in Canvas. For asychronous online classes, you will need to complete the weekly work schedule on time and as specified on the calendar.

### Meet Deadlines
- Meet deadlines for all work—items are due when the calendar specifies and your file submissions must not be corrupted (they have to be readable text in the format I specify). **But**: During the regular semester (not finals week), you may turn in one major (revisable) project assignment up to 48 hours past its due date. Other assignments and activities **do not** come with this option—especially peer review drafts and activities that we do in class. In addition, the deadline for revisions to major projects due during finals week can't be extended because the university imposes a tight deadline on faculty to turn in final grades.

### Read Attentively and Actively
-	Buy, rent, or access any required textbook(s); download or access (and consider printing) all other required readings.
-	Read all assigned readings closely and annotate them thoughtfully *before* class meetings in F2F classes and before you need to use them in online classes. (All readings are fair game for quizzes and other activities).
-	Use active reading strategies, such as [Casey Boyle's six-step reading response](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z1t_ft-HqFO9pK-LQtaASnyqmfh9kbnc6Mp2LzYKjNE/edit?usp=sharing) and the [SQ3R method](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UQpnr27g58ABgOJXQzTny8AD4V2TZGYebM2tKUVjzaM/edit?usp=sharing). 
### Seek Guidance as a Adult Learner
-	Talk to me during in-class workshops, email me as needed, bring me drafts, come to student visiting hours, ask questions, and otherwise use me proactively as a resource. Use an appointment (I'll show you how to set one up) if you can't come see me.
- **NB:** If I ask you to meet with me in person or virtually, you *must* do so. **If I ask to see you, it's not some kind of punishment; rather, it's one grownup asking another to come get expert help that can best be delivered in person.**
- Use [the Writing Center](https://www.stedwards.edu/writing-center) as needed and (especially) if I suggest it.
### Protect your Work
- Save your work in ways that do not make you depend 100% on the health of a particular drive (e.g., use Google Drive).
### Avoid Distractions 
Don’t distract yourself during work time with smartphones, tablets, or computers used for non-work tasks. Ordinarily, there is no reason to text during class, though you (and I) may need to from time to time for various reasons. 

This admonition is even more important in online courses—you must exercise more discipline in online courses to avoid distractions. 

### Dig Into the Work

-	**It all counts--there is no busy work.** Don't just show up/log in/keep from being a distraction. In a college course, you need to offer insights, ask questions, answer questions, bring necessary materials, dig into quizzes, class discussions, and activities, confer during workshops, participate in discussion boards on Canvas, chat in Zoom, and do assigned homework and in-process activities. 
-	If you are asked to do team activities or projects, make yourself available to your teammate, figure out and negotiate how to share the work, and give helpful, honest, detailed responses to any prompt asking you to evaluate your teammate's performance. I generally will use [this rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aTyt2w4UrBqES1jrlHlnNmxtjDqTShSJMAqli1H6sps/edit?usp=sharing) for such a prompt. That is also how you will be evaluated by your teammate. Blowing off a teammate's input, ghosting, or expecting them to do more than their fair share of work are all breaches of the grading contract. I reserve the right to break up teams and assign different grades, if warranted. 
-	Bring (or submit) "good faith full drafts" (your best effort-in-progress attempting the whole project) for peer review sessions. 
-	Give thoughtful, useful, honest peer feedback. 
-	Submit what each assignment or activity asks for, e.g., if an assignment asks for four sections with specific headings or three peer-reviewed scholarly sources, your submission can't ignore such requirements. Don't blast off from the assignment and turn in some other kind of work. This is not to say that you can't be creative, but you need to do what the assignment asks, not just *some of it* or *something sort of like it*.
-	Major assignments will usually ask you to ask me to comment on something specific. Take this opportunity seriously as a way to get useful feedback on your writing centered on your own development and concerns. To help remind you to do so, I use autograded preflight checklists (simple T/F Canvas quizzes). If you claim the points by certifying that you have asked me to comment on something specific, but that turns out not to be true, I will deduct those quiz points.

## II. The Performance-Based Part

-  For major projects, I will use a points-based scale and rubric (as well as comments and feedback). 
- Some work is not revisable (e.g., quizzes, peer review, discussion posts, weekly activiies, etc.), but all major writing projects are revisable. Please read [my revision policies](http://drewloewe.net/policies/). If you revise a major project effectively and follow the policies so I can evaluate it in context, I will simply change the original grade (I don't weight or average them). The grade is not guaranteed to increase, but it will certainly NOT decrease.
- Most work in most courses will be evaluated using a simple point scale. The scale is keyed to the basic four descriptors:
  - **100%--Excellent**--meets all expectations; overall, notably substantive and polished 
  - **85%--Strong**--meets most expectations; overall, solid with a few areas to improve
  - **70%-Passing**--attempts all of the assignment, but overall does not yet meet most expectations; significant areas to improve
  - **0%--Not Passing**--not submitted at all or submitted, but meets few or no expectations; corrupted file; major development or reworking needed 

For major projects, 90% of the available points are for content and 10% are for form and mechanics.

-  Items graded all-or-nothing will have a simple descriptor of the specifications for a good-faith, useful, responsive submission that does what the item is supposed to do (typically, spark discussion or help you work out your ideas). A good-faith, useful, responsive submission earns all the possible points.
-  Depending on the course, you can earn some of the available points just by participating actively, e.g. in class activities or checking your submissions using a preflight checklist. In those instances, and assuming that you've met the criteria, you'll just answer "True" to a simple True/False quiz question set to award you all of those points for an answer of "True." (As other professors have done, I've "hacked" the Canvas quiz function to be a form of self-grading.) If you claim points by certifying something that turns out not to be true, I will deduct those points. 


## III. Final Course Grades

I opt out of the university's plus-minus grading system. I will assign whole grades, e.g., A, B, etc. I will build a structure that offers at least 1000 points to be earned. I grade on a 1000-pt scale, so anything above 1000 total pts is *de facto* "wiggle room/extra credit."

### A 
The student:
- _meets_ the requirements of the labor-based part of this system;
- _earns_ 900+ points on points-graded work in the course
###  B 
The student:
- _meets_ the requirements of the labor-based part of this system;
- _earns_ 800-899 points on points-graded work in the course
### C 
The student:
- _meets_ the requirements of the labor-based part of this system;
- _earns_ 700-799 points on points-graded work in the course
###  NP (in WRIT 1301 or 2302) or D (in other courses) 
The student:
- _meets_ most of the requirements of the labor-based part of this system;
- _earns_ 600-699 points on points-graded work in the course 
- D- is not an available grade at St. Edward's.
### F
The student:
- _meets_ few of the requirements of the labor-based part of this system and
- _earns_ <600 points on points-graded work in the course 
- Or, regardless of other performance, commits a serious act of academic dishonesty as defined by the applicable Bulletin, Student Handbook, or other university policy. (NB: dishonesty can by itself result in a final grade of F).
