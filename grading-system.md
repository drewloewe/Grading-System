# Labor- and Performance-Based Grading System 
- This labor- and performance-based grading system works hand-in-hand with my [course policies](http://drewloewe.net/policies/).
- *NB: These terms are subject to adjustments based on a) an official "504 letter" re: reasonable accommodation of a learning challenge or b) other reasonable actions on a case-by-case basis (please discuss those with me; don't assume anything).
## I. The Labor-Based Part

The labor-based part of this system has seven categories. You are expected to do all of the actions described in each category to fulfill the labor-based part of a grade of C or higher. 
### Category 1: Show Up/Engage Regularly and Punctually; Stay in Touch

**Traditional Classes**: Attend class regularly and on time; do not miss more than three class meetings total and do not miss any peer-review activities; log into Canvas regularly and make sure that you know what is going on, what you have to do, and when; stay in touch with professor and peers. Barring emergencies, I will be in the classroom and you should be, too. 

**Online classes**: Same as above, but you won’t show up to a classroom. Keep on top of the weekly work plans, since you won't have the "personal trainer effect" of coming to a F2F classroom twice a week.

### Category 2: Meet Deadlines and Turn in All Major Projects 
- Meet deadlines for all work. **But**: During the regular semester (not finals week), you may turn in one major (revisable) project assignment up to 48 hours past its due date. Other assignments and activities **do not** come with this option—especially peer review drafts, process work, and activities that we do in class. This kind of work depends on sequencing, iteration, and opportunities for in-process feedback; thus, it is time-sensitive.
- Your file submissions must not be corrupted (they have to be readable or viewable in the format that I specify). A corrupted file is not a submission.
- If I ask you to use a link, you must set the link permission to "anyone with the link can view." 
- The deadline for revisions to major projects due during finals week can't be extended because the university imposes a tight deadline on faculty to turn in final grades.
### Category 3: Read Attentively and Actively
-	Buy, rent, or access any required textbooks; download or access (and consider printing) all other required readings.
-	Read all assigned readings closely and annotate them thoughtfully *before* class meetings in F2F classes and before you need to use them in online classes. 
-	All readings are fair game for quizzes and other activities.
-	Use active reading strategies, such as [Casey Boyle's six-step reading response](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z1t_ft-HqFO9pK-LQtaASnyqmfh9kbnc6Mp2LzYKjNE/edit?usp=sharing) and the [SQ3R method](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UQpnr27g58ABgOJXQzTny8AD4V2TZGYebM2tKUVjzaM/edit?usp=sharing). 
### Category 4: Seek Guidance as an Adult Learner
-	Talk to me during in-class workshops, email me as needed, bring me drafts, come to student visiting hours, ask questions, and otherwise use me proactively as a resource. Use an appointment (I'll show you how to set one up) if you can't come see me during my posted visiting hours.
- **NB:** If I ask you to meet with me in person or virtually, you *must* do so. **If I ask to see you, it's not some kind of punishment; rather, it's one grownup asking another to come get expert help that can best be delivered one on one.**
- Use [the Writing Center](https://www.stedwards.edu/writing-center) as needed and (especially) if I suggest it.
### Category 5: Protect your Work
- Save your work in ways that do not make you depend 100% on the health of a particular drive or computer. In the 2020s, with abundant and redundant storage, drive failure is not really an acceptable excuse in most cases.
- I will try to help you with technical problems to best of my ability, but you are responsible for submitting uncorrupted files. 
### Category 6: Don't Distract Yourself or Others
- Don’t distract yourself or others during class time, especially when we are writing in class. Side conversations unrelated to our work are distracting.
- Ordinarily, there is no reason to text or IM people during class, although you (and I) may need to text from time to time for various legitimate reasons, such as emergencies.
- In online classes, you will have to exercise a lot of self-control because you will be doing most of your work on your own and not in a classroom setting. I use and recommend [the free Self Control app](https://selfcontrolapp.com/). There are probably others like it for Windows. 

### Category 7: Dig Into the Work

-	**It all counts--there is no busy work.** Don't just show up/log in/keep from being a distraction; that's a bare minimum. In a college course for adult learners, you need to offer insights; ask questions; answer questions; bring necessary materials; dig into quizzes, class discussions, and activities; confer during workshops; participate in discussion boards on Canvas; and do assigned homework and in-process activities.  
-	Submit timely drafts for peer review sessions. 
-	Give thoughtful, useful, honest feedback in peer review. 
-	Submit what each assignment or activity asks for, e.g., if an assignment asks for four sections with specific headings or three peer-reviewed scholarly sources, your submission can't ignore such requirements. Answer discussion prompts fully, according to what I ask you and what the evaluation criteria of the prompt specify (so, a one-sentence post does not count). Don't blast off from the assignment and turn in some other kind of work that is "kinda-sorta related." This is not to say that you can't be creative, but you need to do what the assignment asks, not just *some of it* or *something sort of like it*. If you don't know what the assignment requires you to submit, please ask.
-	If you are asked to submit something that I will mark Complete or Incomplete, please submit it on time and submit what is asked for. Late, partial, or off-topic submissions will likely receive a mark of Incomplete. 
-	Read (or watch) and take notes on the feedback that I give you.
-	I have many students in a typical term. **So, please submit work where and how I ask you to submit it.** For instance, if I ask you to submit something in Canvas as a .docx file, submit it in Canvas as a .docx file rather than emailing it or linking me to a Google Doc. I won't chase down various channels in which students might have submitted work.
-	If you use generative AI technologies in your work, make the disclosures that the [Policy for Ethical Use of Generative AI Technologies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1onwUP12kIqcU2-s-xjEMY-UJ4cWf-8xApCE3gxTcQB0/edit?usp=sharing) requires.

## II. The Performance-Based Part

-  For major projects, I will use a points-based scale and rubric (as well as comments and feedback). 
- Some work is not revisable (e.g., quizzes, peer review, discussion posts, weekly activities, synthesis charts, etc.), but all major writing projects are revisable. Please read [my revision policies](http://drewloewe.net/policies/). If you revise a major project effectively and follow the policies so I can evaluate it in context, I will simply change the original grade (I don't weight or average them; revisions are "do-overs"). The grade is not guaranteed to increase, but it will certainly NOT decrease.
- Most work in most courses will be evaluated using a simple point scale and a specific rubric. The point scale is keyed to four basic descriptors:

  - **100%--Excellent**--follows all directions; meets all expectations for what the assignment asks you to develop; overall, notably substantive and polished 
  - **85%--Strong**--follows all directions; meets most expectations for what the assignment asks you to develop; overall, solid with a few areas to improve
  - **70%-Passing**--may or may not follow all directions; overall does not yet meet most expectations for what the assignment asks you to develop; significant areas to improve
  - **0%--Not Passing**--*even if submitted:* may or may not follow all directions; overall, meets few or no expectations for what the assignment asks you to develop (major development, refocusing, or reworking needed); *if not submitted*: unreadable file, non-working link, or not submitted at all

- The first thing I look for in any submission in any class is: *does this do all of what is expected in the writing situation?* If it does one thing, kinda-sorta does some other things, and simply does not do other things at all, there is a problem that revision can address, but that keeps the initial submission from passing. **You must submit all of what an assignment asks for, or it cannot pass. I don't do, say, 50% partial credit for "just turning something in" on major submissions. The available grades are 0%, 70%, 85%, and 100%.**
-  When I get a “kinda-sorta + omissions” submission, I feel like a diner who is served half a hamburger on a whole-wheat bun, sweet potato fries, and pickled okra when I ordered a whole burger on brioche, waffle fries, and grilled vegetables. This “wait...what?” situation is why I don’t use partial credit schemes for non-passing submissions. I view such schemes as contrived, infantilizing, and debilitating for all concerned. I would not give the restaurant 50% of the cost of what I actually ordered if I was served something other than what I ordered. I give feedback and a “do-over” chance, which is what happens among adults all the time in all kinds of situations.

Here is another way of looking at the mentality behind the grading system that I use:

|                 | Followed all directions? | Developed everything asked for? | Performance on what was developed:                 |
|-----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Excellent (100%)       | Yes                      | Yes                             | Notably well-executed                              |
| Strong   (85%)       | Yes                      | Yes                             | Minor areas for improvement; eligible for do-over revision                       |
| Passing  (70%)       | Maybe                    | Probably not                               | Significant areas for improvement;  eligible for do-over revision           |
| Not Yet Passing (0%)| Most likely not          | Almost certainly not                        | Major development, refocusing, or reworking needed;  eligible for do-over revision |

---


- For major projects, 90% of the available points are for content and 10% are for form and mechanics.

-  Items graded all-or-nothing or Complete/Incomplete will have a simple descriptor of the specifications for a good-faith, useful, responsive submission that does what the item is supposed to do (typically, spark discussion, help you work out your ideas, or give me useful information about questions that students have). A good-faith, useful, responsive submission earns all the possible points.




## III. Final Course Grades

I opted out of the university's plus-minus grading system. I assign whole grades, e.g., A, B, etc. In classes except WRIT 3330: The Craft of Editing, I will build a structure that offers *at least* 1000 points to be earned. I grade on a 1000-pt scale, so anything above 1000 total pts is *de facto* "extra credit" or "wiggle room."

| Your Final Grade       | Your Labor                                                    | Your Performance |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| A                      | You did all of the actions described in the seven categories above  | 900+ pts, at least 90% of Complete/Incomplete items completed        |
| B                      | You did all of the actions described in the seven categories above | 800-899 pts, 80% of Complete/Incomplete items completed      |
| C                      | You did all of the actions described in the seven categories above | 700-799 pts, 70% of Complete/Incomplete items completed      |
| D (or NP in WRIT 2302) | You did some of the actions described in the seven categories above| 600-699 pts, 60%  of Complete/Incomplete items completed     |
| F                      | You did few of the actions described in the seven categories above| <600 pts         |

In WRIT 3330: The Craft of Editing, I made *a lot* of points available when overhauling the course—so many, in fact, that my usual "earn 900 points for an A, 800 for a B" standard would not be useful. So, for that course, available final course grades are as follows:

| Your Final Grade       | Your Labor                                                    | Your Performance |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| A                      | You did all of the actions described in the seven categories above  | at least 87% of available points earned, at least 90% of Complete/Incomplete items completed        |
| B                      | You did all of the actions described in the seven categories above | 77%-86% of available points earned, 80% of Complete/Incomplete items completed      |
| C                      | You did all of the actions described in the seven categories above | 67%-76% of available points earned, 70% of Complete/Incomplete items completed      |
| D (or NP in WRIT 2302) | You did some of the actions described in the seven categories above| 57%-66% of available points earned, 60%  of Complete/Incomplete items completed     |
| F                      | You did few of the actions described in the seven categories above| <57% of available points earned        |
Note: regardless of their other performance in a course, a student who commits a serious act of academic dishonesty as defined by the applicable Bulletin, Student Handbook, or other university policy might be assigned a final grade of F for that course.
